## Intro

Blackjack, also known by some as Twenty One, is a card game that goes back as far as the 1600s. The game's name became colloquially known as Blackjack during it's early debut at casinos. Bets paid **TEN TO ONE** if the players hand contained an Ace of Spades and a Jack of Spades or Clubs off the first draw.

Since it's introduction to Las Vegas, Blackjack has become one of the most popular cards games from beginners to seasoned players alike. Blackjack is relatively easy to learn while also adaptable to higher levels of play containing statistical strategy and a dash of luck. 


### Basic Rules

Blackjack can be played with 2-6 players against a dealer. The main idea to remember is that no matter how many people are at the table, **you will always compare your hands to the dealers hand**.

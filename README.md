## Intro

Blackjack, also known by some as Twenty One, is a card game that goes back as far as the 1600s. The game's name became colloquially known as Blackjack during it's early debut at casinos. Bets paid **TEN TO ONE** if the players hand contained an Ace of Spades and a Jack of Spades or Clubs off the first draw.

Since it's introduction to Las Vegas, Blackjack has become one of the most popular cards games from beginners to seasoned players alike. Blackjack is relatively easy to learn while also adaptable to higher levels of play containing statistical strategy and a dash of luck. 


### Basic Rules
----

Blackjack can be played with 2-6 players against a dealer. The main idea to remember is that no matter how many people are at the table, **you will always compare your hands to the dealers hand**.

#### How To Win

* Draw a 21 on the first hand (Ace and Face Card) ![Blackjack Hand](http://i.imgur.com/bRXak7E.png)
* Hand is closest to 21 without going over 
* Dealer's hand goes over 21 (Bust)

#### Game Play

* Start with your bet
* Dealer deals hands in clockwise order (or if two players, player dealt first then dealer) until all players have 2 cards to start
* Dealer keeps their second card hidden until player stands
* Player performs actions first (see Player Actions below)
* Once Player stands, Dealer shows cards and plays out their hand
* If no one BUSTS, cards are compared to see which player has 21 or the closest to 21

#### Player Actions 


Action | Meaning
---- | ----
Bet | Player places their bet on the table to initiate game
Hit | Draws extra cards to allow your hand to get to 21
Stand | Stops dealer from adding cards to your hand

And now you're ready to play and WIN!
